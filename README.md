# hgrid-css

## **A Lightweight and Practical CSS Utility Kit.**

### Zero Config. Flat Learning Curve.

**Hgrid** is a starting point intended to make HTML work out of the box. It's not a UI framework, but provides sensible defaults so you can start prototyping without having to deal with browser quirks, unstyled elements and basic responsivity.

## How to use

Documentation: [https://hgrid.io](https://hgrid.io)

## How to install

### **As a node module:**

```bash
npm install hgrid-css --save-dev
```

```bash
yarn add hgrid-css --dev
```

### **Then, @use as Sass in your project:**

```scss
@use 'hgrid-css/sass/hgrid' with (

  // example customization

  $link-color: #ffe88d,
  $link-color-hover: #fff0b4,
  $container-max-width: 1600px,
  $link-underline-color: #ffe88d,
  $use-global-link-underlines: true,
  $include-grid: false
);
```
For detailed information with step by step recipes on how to integrate **hgrid** in different JS frameworks, please refer to [the documentation](https://hgrid.io/documentation/integrate/).

### **From local file or CDN:**

```html
<head>
  <!-- Without CSS grid utilities (slimmer) -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/hgrid-css@latest/dist/hgrid.min.css">

  <!-- Including CSS grid utilities (heavier) -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/hgrid-css@latest/dist/hgrid.grid.min.css">
</head>
```
### **@import into your stylesheet:**
```css
/* From node_modules */
@import './../etc./node_modules/hgrid-css/dist/hgrid.min.css';
```
```css
/* From CDN */
@import 'https://unpkg.com/hgrid-css@latest/dist/hgrid.min.css';
```

## Local development

_Requires Node.js installed on your system (or use an editor plugin such as [live-sass](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass))_

Run `npm install` from the root of the **hgrid-css** folder.

Start compiling **hgrid**'s `.scss` files to `.css` with the command `npm run watch`. Changes you make to files in the `/sass` folder will result in css files being updated in the `/dist` folder.

To produce the compiled, prefixed and minified **hgrid** output, use `npm run build`. It uses Autoprefixer to add some backwards compatibility before minifying the result as `hgrid.min.css`.

See [hgrid.io/documentation/installation](https://hgrid.io/documentation/installation/) for complete usage instructions.
